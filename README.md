> Minecraft resource pack featuring color-corrected clay, new wood, some new doors, new glowstone, paintings, black brick, and more.

The aim of this mod is simple: Enhance the currently available textures by making them more suitable for a larger array of build styles, while also not restricting or completely revamping the way that Minecraft already looks.

This resource pack was made for our server called Polar Galaxy: [Learn more](https://polargalaxy.com)

## Server usage

This pack can also be used for servers (Spigot/Sponge not required). Just pick a version that is suitable for your use case and game version from that same release page, then right-click on the packaged zip file link. Hit “Copy link address.” Now, go to your `server.properties` file, and copy that URL to the 35th line. Your properties file should now look something like this (except the version number will be different):

```
resource-pack=https://github.com/PolarGalaxyMC/goggles/releases/download/2.0/pack.zip
```

If it does, save it and restart the server. Players will now be prompted to use the pack upon logging in. If you see any extra backslashes after restarting the server in your configuration file—[do not remove them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character)!

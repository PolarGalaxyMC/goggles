> This Minecraft resource pack‚Äîthis modification that changes the game‚Äôs textures‚Äîis a close alternative to the default look, with some changes that compliment complex structures.

The goal is to enhance the currently available textures by making them more suitable for a larger array of styles, structures, and all while also not restricting or completely revamping the way that the game already looks. For example, such a modification would be suitable for cities or other non-medieval builds.

For a more in-depth overview, please [visit the MC-Goggles website](https://mc-goggles.netlify.com).

## Usage

Download the preferred version of the mod from [the releases page](https://github.com/mistermantas/goggles/releases). Make sure to download the zip file and not the source code.

(Take a look at [this tutorial](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack) if you are not familiar with loading a resource pack.)

This pack can also be used on any server. From the release page, right-click on a packaged zip file link and copy it. Now, go to your `server.properties` file, and copy that URL like this:

```
resource-pack=https://github.com/mistermantas/goggles/releases/download/4.0/pack.zip
```

Save your edited file and restart the server. Players will now be prompted to use the pack upon logging in. If you see any extra backslashes after restarting the server in your configuration file, [do not remove them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character)!

This is a Minecraft resource pack that includes color-corrected clay, glass doors, updated glowstone, and new birch. The Goggles resource pack aims to enhance the currently available textures by making them more suitable for a larger array of build styles, while also not restricting or completely revamping the way that vanilla Minecraft looks.

If you’d like to see a live demo of the pack without needing to do any additional configuration, then join the [Polar Galaxy Minecraft server](https://polargalaxy.com).

## Installation

### For personal use

You can download the latest version of the pack on [our GitHub releases page](https://github.com/PolarGalaxyMC/goggles/releases).

This resource pack is installed just like any other, however, if you’re not familiar with resource pack installation—take a look at [this tutorial](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack).

### For servers

Go to your `server.properties` file and copy this bit of code to the 35th line:

```
resource-pack=https\://github.com/PolarGalaxyMC/goggles/releases/download/1.1.0/pack.zip
```

Do not remove the backslashes. Save the server properties file and restart the server. Players will now be prompted to use the pack upon login.

This is a Minecraft resource pack that includes color-corrected clay, glass doors, updated glowstone, and more. The Goggles resource pack aims to enhance the currently available textures by making them more suitable for a larger array of build styles, while also not restricting or completely revamping the way vanilla Minecraft looks.

> You can use this pack without any additional configuration on [the Polar Galaxy Minecraft server](https://polargalaxy.com).

## Installation

### For yourself

You can download the latest version of the pack on [the releases page](https://github.com/PolarGalaxyMC/goggles/releases). After you have done that, install the pack as usual.

If you’re not familiar with resource pack installation—take a look at [this tutorial](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack).

### For servers

From [the releases page](https://github.com/PolarGalaxyMC/goggles/releases), pick a version that is suitable for your use case and game version. Right-click on the packaged zip file link and click “Copy link address.”

Now, go to your `server.properties` file, and copy that URL to the 35th line. Your properties file should now look something like this:

```
resource-pack=https://github.com/PolarGalaxyMC/goggles/releases/download/2.0.0/pack.zip
```

If it does, save the server properties file, and restart the server. Players will now be prompted to use the pack upon logging in. If you see any extra backslashes after restarting the server in your configuration file—[do not remove them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character)!

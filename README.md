# Happle’s Goggles

This is a Minecraft resource pack that includes color-corrected clay, glass doors, updated glowstone, and new birch. The Goggles resource pack aims to enhance the currently available textures by making them more suitable for a larger array of build styles, while also not restricting or completely revamping the way that vanilla Minecraft looks.

If you’d like to see a live demo of the pack without needing to do any additional configuration, then join the [Polar Galaxy Minecraft server](https://polargalaxy.com).

## Installation

This resource pack is installed just like any other, however, if you’re not familiar with resource pack installation—take a look at [this tutorial](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack).
